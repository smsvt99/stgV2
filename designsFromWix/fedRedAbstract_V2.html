                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this action, EPA is taking final action on the
                    portions of the June 13, 2001 proposed rule revisions that modify the existing requirements for
                    sources affected by the Acid Rain Program and by the NOX Budget Trading Program under the October
                    27, 1998 NOX SIP Call. Certain changes to the proposed rule revisions have been made based on the
                    public comments received. EPA is not finalizing the proposed changes at this time to the Appeal
                    Procedures or to the Findings of Significant Contribution and Rulemaking on Section 126 Petitions
                    for Purposes of Reducing Interstate Ozone Transport. Today's final rule establishes additional
                    flexibility and options for sources in meeting the continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS)
                    requirements under programs to reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions. These revisions
                    may apply to sources that monitor and report emissions only during the ozone season, as well as to
                    sources that monitor and report emissions for the entire year. The provision

          <h2 id="h-9">II. Background and Summary of Final Rule </h2>

          <p id="p-54" data-page="40395">Today's action modifies existing monitoring and reporting requirements in <a class="cfr external" href="/select-citation/2002/06/12/40-CFR-72">40 CFR parts 72</a> and 75. These requirements support emission control programs that use the monitoring and reporting provisions of part 75, such as the Acid Rain Program, and the NO<sub>X</sub> Budget Trading Program developed under the October 27, 1998, NO<sub>X</sub> SIP Call. The emphasis of these revisions is three-fold: (1) To streamline the rule by eliminating outdated sections; (2) to make technical corrections and clarifications to the rule; and (3) to add flexibility to the monitoring and reporting requirements. The most substantive changes finalized are as follows: the definitions of “pipeline natural gas” and “natural gas” in §&thinsp;72.2 are finalized as proposed to remove all references to the H<sub>2</sub> S content of the fuel and instead be based on total sulfur content, along with corresponding changes appendix D to part 75; the low mass emissions (LME) units provisions in §&thinsp;75.19 are clarified and expanded and, for units with certain types of NO<sub>X</sub> emission controls, qualification as a LME unit is made easier; the CEMS missing data procedures are revised to allow fuel-specific missing data substitution; the missing data procedures in subpart H of part 75 are expanded and clarified for sources that are non-load based and/or report emission data only in the ozone season; the NO<sub>X</sub> span and range provisions in appendix A are revised to make them easier to implement for combustion turbines; and the alternate calibration error limit for daily operation is changed from 10 ppm to 5 ppm for units with span values of 50 ppm or less.</p>
          <p id="p-55" data-page="40395">EPA has developed a Response to Comment document (see Docket No. A-2000-33, Item V-C-1) as a supplement to this preamble, which addresses all the comments received on the proposed rule revisions. Comments that were raised and are not addressed in this preamble are responded to in this supplemental document. </p>
          <h2 id="h-10">III. Statutory Authority, Regulatory History, and Stakeholder Involvement </h2>

          <p id="p-56" data-page="40395">In accordance with titles I and IV of the Clean Air Act (CAA, or the Act), with today's action EPA is promulgating revisions to rules implementing programs that the Agency has established to mitigate interstate transport of nitrogen oxides, as well as to reduce the acidic deposition precursor emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. EPA originally promulgated <a class="cfr external" href="/select-citation/2002/06/12/40-CFR-72">40 CFR parts 72</a> and 75 on January 11, 1993, to implement the Acid Rain Program as authorized by title IV of the Act. EPA has subsequently promulgated several final rules revising CEMS requirements in part 75 and relevant definitions in part 72 (<em>see</em> below). </p>

          <p id="p-57" data-page="40395">Section 110 of the Act requires that State Implementation Plans (SIPs) prohibit sources from contributing significantly to nonattainment or maintenance of attainment in another State. On October 27, 1998, EPA issued the NO<sub>X</sub> SIP Call, a final rule under section 110 requiring certain States to revise their SIPs to meet NO<sub>X</sub> emission budgets to prevent such significant contribution to ozone nonattainment. States may adopt in their SIPs a NO<sub>X</sub> Budget Trading Program for large electric generating units (EGUs) and large non-electric generating units (non-EGUs) and require such units to monitor under part 75. Further, section 126 of the Act authorizes EPA to directly regulate, and require reductions of NO<sub>X</sub> emissions from, sources that emit in violation of the prohibition in section 110 against significantly contributing to ozone nonattainment or maintenance problems in a downwind State. On January 18, 2000, EPA published a finding that large EGUs and certain large non-EGUs in particular States named in petitions filed by several northeastern States emit NO<sub>X</sub> in violation of Section 126 of the CAA (<a href="/citation/65-FR-2674">65 FR 2674</a>). In that same notice, the EPA finalized the Federal NO<sub>X</sub> Budget Trading Program in part 97 as the control remedy and required that these units monitor under part 75. </p>

          <p id="p-58" data-page="40395">In today's rule, the provisions of parts 72 and 75 are revised to modify the requirements for sources under the Acid Rain Program, the NO<sub>X</sub> SIP Call, and the Federal NO<sub>X</sub> Budget Trading Program. </p>

          <p id="p-59" data-page="40395">As noted above, the Agency first promulgated parts 72 and 75 under title IV on January 11, 1993. On May 17, 1995 and November 20, 1996, the Agency revised parts 72 and 75 to make implementation simpler (<a href="/citation/60-FR-26510">60 FR 26510</a> and <a href="/citation/61-FR-59142">61 FR 59142</a>). On May 21, 1998, the Agency proposed additional revisions to parts 72 and 75 to make implementation easier and more efficient, to improve quality assurance requirements, and to create new alternative monitoring options (<a href="/citation/63-FR-28032">63 FR 28032</a>). EPA promulgated final rule revisions addressing some of these additional proposed revisions, based on comments received, when EPA promulgated the NO<sub>X</sub> SIP Call (<a href="/citation/63-FR-57356">63 FR 57356</a>). On May 26, 1999, EPA issued final rule revisions addressing the remaining May 21, 1998 proposed revisions (<a href="/citation/64-FR-28564">64 FR 28564</a>). On June 13, 2001, EPA proposed further revisions to parts 72, 75, 78, and 97 (<a href="/citation/66-FR-31978">66 FR 31978</a>). The revisions to parts 72 and 75 are being finalized in today's rule, while the changes to parts 78 and 97 will be addressed in a later rulemaking. </p>

          <p id="p-60" data-page="40395">Throughout the implementation of the Acid Rain Program, particularly since 1995, EPA has worked and continues to work on a regular basis with stakeholders, the regulated community, the public, other state and local agencies, and environmental groups and consultants. Internally, EPA holds frequent policy meetings to discuss many of the questions and problems that affected sources raise to their Regional contact in EPA. Many of the changes in today's rule result from industry petitions to the Agency as well as comments, phone calls, and dialogues during conferences and workshops. Most recently, EPA conducted two conferences in July (Louisville, KY) and September (Alexandria, VA) of 2001, and then initiated five regional workshops targeted at the regulated community and state agencies to support the Acid Rain Program and assist in implementing the NO<sub>X</sub> Budget Trading Program. EPA is committed to this ongoing interaction with stakeholders across all spectra. </p>
          <h2 id="h-11">IV. Summary of Major Comments and Responses </h2>

          <p id="p-61" data-page="40395">EPA responded to all comments received by the close of the extended comment period, August 20, 2001, regarding the current proposal. EPA's responses are summarized in this section of the preamble and are available in their entirety in the Response to Comment document in the rule docket (<em>see</em> Docket No. A-2000-33, Item V-C-1). The majority of comments related to parts 72 and 75; therefore, this section addresses those issues. Revisions to part 78 received no comments, and revisions to part 97 received only two comments, both of which are addressed in the Response to <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="40396"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-40396" data-page="40396" data-text=" 40396" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data="{&quot;page&quot;: 40396}"><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text"> 40396</span></span></span>Comment document. As noted above, EPA intends to finalize changes to part 78 and 97 in a separate rulemaking. The major topics in part 75 that EPA is focusing on in this section are: missing data; LME units; quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC); appendix D; other highlights and changes; and streamlining changes. </p>
          <h3 id="h-12">A. Missing Data </h3>
          <h4 id="h-13">1. What Changes to the CEMS Missing Data Procedures of §§&thinsp;75.31 Through 75.37 Are Finalized? </h4>
          <h4 id="h-14">Background </h4>
          <h4 id="h-15">a. What is Currently Required? </h4>
          <p id="p-62" data-page="40396">The part 75 CEMS missing data procedures in §§&thinsp;75.31 through 75.37 require the use of substitute data values for each unit operating hour in which quality-assured data are not obtained, either from a certified CEMS, a reference method, or an approved alternative monitoring system. The method of determining the appropriate substitute data values depends principally on two things: (1) the length of the missing data period; and (2) the percent monitor data availability at the end of the missing data period. </p>

          <p id="p-63" data-page="40396">Existing part 75 missing data procedures do not take into consideration the type of fuel combusted. Rather, a single database of quality-assured monitor operating hours is maintained for each monitored parameter (<em>e.g.,</em> SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>X</sub>, flow rate) in order to provide substitute data values when a historical lookback is required. </p>
          <p id="p-64" data-page="40396">For units with add-on SO<sub>2</sub> or NO<sub>X</sub> emission controls, §&thinsp;75.34 allows two principal missing data options. The owner or operator may either: (1) Report maximum potential values or, if the controls are documented to be operating properly, report the standard missing data procedures; or (2) petition the Administrator to develop and use site-specific parametric monitoring procedures for missing data substitution in lieu of using the standard missing data procedures. Section 75.34(a)(2) also allows the owner or operator to petition the Administrator for permission to report the maximum controlled emission rate recorded in the previous 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours (without regard to control operational status), in cases where the standard missing data routines would require the maximum value in the lookback period to be reported.</p>
          <h4 id="h-16">b. What Changes Were Proposed? </h4>
          <p id="p-65" data-page="40396">On June 13, 2001, EPA proposed to revise the part 75 missing data procedures to allow the standard missing data substitution in §&thinsp;75.33 to be done on a fuel-specific basis. The proposed revisions would allow the owner or operator to create and maintain separate databases for missing data purposes for each type of fuel combusted in the unit. Substitute data values would be derived from the appropriate database, depending on the type of fuel being burned during the missing data period. </p>
          <p id="p-66" data-page="40396">For units with add-on SO<sub>2</sub> or NO<sub>X</sub> emission controls, EPA further proposed to remove the petition provision from §&thinsp;75.34(a)(2) and replace it with a new missing data option, based on the operating status of the emission controls. The owner or operator of a unit with add-on SO<sub>2</sub> or NO<sub>X</sub> emission controls would be allowed to create and maintain two separate databases, controlled and uncontrolled, for missing data purposes. Any hour in which the add-on controls were documented to be operating (<em>i.e.,</em> on) would be included in the controlled database. Any hour in which the controls were not operating (<em>i.e.,</em> off) would be included in the uncontrolled database. The appropriate substitute data value for each hour of a missing data period would be taken from either the controlled or uncontrolled database, depending on whether the emission controls were documented (by means of parametric data) to be operating properly during the hour. </p>
